# lotto

## Description

Just a project to play about with the new Symfony 2 framework. The project will
allow myself and my friends to track the lottery numbers we play each week, detailing
info such as who has paid, what numbers we're playing, how much we've spent and won.
The project is purely for the purpose of learning and just for some fun :) (Maybe a
PhoneGap mobile version will spawn out of it too)
